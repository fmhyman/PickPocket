<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A python script to copy all your Pocket saves to a database in Notion. Current iteration is based off the HTML export option provided by the folks at Pocket.

**Intended for**
- Those who are looking to transfer their reading lists from Pocket to Notion.
- Those who want to keep track and analyze what they read.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* A Pocket account to retreive your saved content from.
* A Notion account to store your links.
* Python 3 on your system to run the code.
  
### Setup & Installation
 
1. Clone this repository.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/paperboi/PickPocket.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory and install the pre-requisite packages using
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
1. Export your Pocket saves from [here](https://help.getpocket.com/article/1015-exporting-your-pocket-list).
2. Duplicate this [database template](https://www.notion.so/personaljeff/e4a0751a114842c6b2b238218e52e7d2?v=062127a6aa4341fb98e6d74b0eadfc4c) to your Notion workspace. Copy-paste the database address to the  variable.
3. Since this code requires access of non-public pages, an authentication token from your Notion page is required. This token is stored in the `token_v2` cookie. This can be found in the *Storage* tab of your browser's developer tools.
   - For Chrome: Open Developer Tools (*Menu > Other tools > Developer Tools*), navigate to Application tab and go to *Storage\Cookies* to find the token.
4. Store the path to your HTML file, the address to your database and the `token_v2` value as `PATH_POCKET_FILE`, `NOTION_TABLE_ID` and `NOTION_TOKEN` respectively in a `.env` file in the same directory you have cloned this repository to. 
To execute the script, navigate to the directory and run
   ```
   python pocket2notion.py
  ```
